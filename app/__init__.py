# Import the Flask class from the flask package (i.e. folder)
from flask import Flask

# This statement sets the app variable, which sets the app's name to main
# when this file is started using the run button or command line run
app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='../templates')
app.static_folder = '../static'

# This import must come AFTER the statement: app = Flask (__name__)
# The reason for this is that routes.py refers to the app variable above.
# So, the import must be after this app= variable so that routes can refer to the app variable, above.
# That's why this import isnâ€™t at the top, unlike PyCharm's recommendation
# This tells Python to check the routes file in this app package
# This file determines what function each HTML route/page should run
from app import routes
